Changes between RDML v1.0 to v 1.1

- dataType

    The element quantity was removed. The quantity is a result of calculation and 
    should be given in the result section which will be implemented in a future 
    version. 
    
    If a cq-value is not available, the cq value must be set to -1.0.
    
- dyeType
    
    A new top level element for the dye. Each target must in v1.1 refer to a dye to 
    allow reconstruction of a plate in multiplex situations (could lead to undefined 
    situations in v1.0).
    
- pcrFormatType
    
    The pcrTormatType was redesigned. In v1.0 every new plate setup required an 
    update of the schema. In v1.1 the plate setup is defined by providing columns 
    and rows in combination with a numbering schema for the wells (left to right, 
    rows first). The wells are numbered by position and not by use, the 
    letter+number id is dropped.
    
- primingMethodType
    
    The method "other" was added to the list.
    
- reactType
    
    The id format was changed to int. All reactions should be numbered by position 
    as described (left to right, rows first). The wells are numbered by position and 
    not by use, the letter+number id is dropped.
    
- sampleType
    
    The elements templateRNAQuantity and templateDNAQuantity were changed from 
    double to quantityType giving more freedom in providing quantity information.
    
- sampleTypeType
    
    The sample types ntp (no target present), nrt (minusRT) and pos (positive 
    control) were added.
    
- targetType
    
    A descriptive string amplificationEfficiencyMethod was introduced for the user 
    to provide information on the method of amplification efficiency calculation.
    
    The element dyeId must refer to a dye element by id (it was an optional string 
    in v1.0). 
    
- thirdPartyExtensionsType
    
    The element allowing third party extensions was removed. The extensions should 
    be provided as seperate files and included into the RDML archive before 
    compression. See Introduction_to_RDML.txt for details.
    
- rdml
    
    The element dye was added which is used by the target elements.
