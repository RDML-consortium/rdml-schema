Changes between RDML v1.2 to v 1.3

Digital PCR measure a high number of partitions. To not overload 
the XML file with this data, separate table files are used that 
are stored in a partitions folder within the RDML zip file. The 
counts of the partitions must be stored in the XML file within
the corresponding data elements.

The table files must use tabs (\t) as column separators and dots 
(.) as decimal separators. A line must contain the data of one
partition. For each fluorescence two columns are created. One with
the endpoint fluorescence value and a second with its score. The
score can be:
  u - undefined or not yet scored
  p - positive
  n - negative
  e - excluded (should be ignored)
The file must have a header line with the target ids matching the 
fluorescence value.

The first lines could look like:
GAPDH\tGAPDH\tHBV\tHBV\n
3412.32\tp\t121.89\tn\n
239.23\tn\t3459.27\tp\n

Changes on the RDML XML structures:

- reactType

    data: The element can now occur 0(!) to unlimited times.
      As data can also be in the partitions element, there can be 
      RDML files without data elements.

    partitions: The new element can occur 0 to one times.
      Reactions split up in partitions as in digital PCR must 
      report data using this elements.

      
- partitionsType

    volume: New element
      This element contains the average volume of one partition 
      in nanoliter (nl).

    endPtTable: New optional element
      This element contains the filename string. See fist section.

    data (partitionDataType): The element can occur 1 to unlimited times.
      As data can also be in the partitions element, there can be
      RDML files without data elements.


- partitionDataType

    tar: New element
      The target id.

    excluded: New optional element
      If present, the data element should be excluded. It should contain a
      string explaining the reason for exclusion. Several reasons for
      exclusion should be seperated by semicolons ";".

    note: New optional element
      A note string similar to "excluded". It may contain a string with notes
      to the data element which do not lead to exclusion of the entry.
      Several notes should be seperated by semicolons ";".

    pos: New element
      Positive partitions - The number of positive partitions.

    neg: New element
      Negative partitions - The number of negative partitions.

    undef: New optional element
      Undefined partitions - The number of undefined or not yet scored partitions.

    excl: New optional element
      Excluded partitions - The number of excluded partitions.

    conc: New optional element
      Concentration - The concentration in copies per microliter reaction mix.


- dataType

    ampEffMet: New element
      Amplification efficiency method as free text.

    N0: New element
      Pronounced N-zero. Target quantity or starting concentration per
      reaction, expressed in calculated arbitrary fluorescence units.
      Negative values are used to express following conditions:
      Not Available: -1.0

    ampEff: New element
      Amplification efficiency should as the fold-increase of DNA per
      cycle (the base of the exponential function), for example 1.95
      for 95% efficiency.
      If absent, the ideal efficiency of 2.0 should be used for
      calculations.

    ampEffSE: New element
      The standard error of the value provided in "ampEff" should be given.

    corrF: New element
      The correction factor indicating the fraction of the expected
      product in all products. A factor of 0.25 indicates that the
      expected product contributes only a quarter to the observed
      results.
      corrN0 = (N0 * corrF) / corrP
      If absent, the ideal correction factor of 1.0 should be used
      for calculations.

    corrP: New element
      The correction factor to correct for inter run differences
      within this experiment.
      corrN0 = (N0 * corrF) / corrP
      If absent, the ideal correction factor of 1.0 should be used
      for calculations.
      Negative values are used to express following conditions:
      Not Available: -1.0

    corrCq: New element
      Corrected quantification cycle - The corrected calculated fractional
      PCR cycle used for downstream quantification.
      Negative values are used to express following conditions:
      Not Available: -1.0

    meltTemp: New element
      The melting temperature in degrees Celsius of the amplified amplicon.

    note: New element
      A note string similar to "excl". It may contain a string with notes
      to the data element which do not lead to exclusion of the entry.
      Several notes should be seperated by semicolons ";".


- targetType

    meltingTemperature: New optional element
      The melting temperature in degrees Celsius of the amplified amplicon.

- dyeType

    dyeChemistry: New optional element
      The monitoring chemistry of this dye. The options are:
        - non-saturating DNA binding dye (SYBR Green I)
        - saturating DNA binding dye (Eva Green, LC Green Plus, BEBO, Syto9)
        - hybridization probe (Molecular Beacon, Light-Up probes, BHQnova Probe)
        - hydrolysis probe (TaqMan, NuPCR)
        - labelled forward primer (LUX primer)
        - labelled reverse primer (Scorpion probe, Sunrise probe, Amplifluor Universal detection system)
        - DNA-zyme probe (QZyme probe)

- sampleType

    type: Uses new element sampleTargetType and can occur 0 to unlimited times.
      The same sample could have the sampleTypeType pos for one target and ntp
      for a different target. Therefor several entries are allowed and can be
      linked to a target. If no target is given, only one entry should be
      present valid for all targets in this run.
      If the element type is absent, the sample type is "unkn" (default value).

    quantity: The element can occur 1 to unlimited times. It can have the target
      as attribute targetId.
      The same sample could have the quantityType 1000 copies per microliter for one
      target or 1 fold for all targets. Optical calibrators work independent of
      targets. Therefor several entries with or without target are allowed and can be
      linked to a target.
