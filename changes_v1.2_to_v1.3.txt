Changes between RDML v1.2 to v 1.3

Digital PCR measure a high number of partitions. To not overload 
the XML file with this data, separate table files are used that 
are stored in a partitions folder within the RDML zip file. The 
counts of the partitions must be stored in the XML file within
the corresponding data elements.

The table files must use tabs (\t) as column separators and dots 
(.) as decimal separators. A line must contain the data of one
partition. For each fluorescence two columns are created. One with
the endpoint fluorescence value and a second with its score. The
score can be:
  u - undefined or not yet scored
  p - positive
  n - negative
  e - excluded (should be ignored)
The file must have a header line with the target ids matching the 
fluorescence value.

The first lines could look like:
GAPDH\tGAPDH\tHBV\tHBV\n
3412.32\tp\t121.89\tn\n
239.23\tn\t3459.27\tp\n

Changes on the RDML XML structures:

- reactType

    data: The element can now occur 0(!) to unlimited times.
      As data can also be in the partitions element, there can be 
      RDML files without data elements.

    partitions: The new element can occur 0 to one times.
      Reactions split up in partitions as in digital PCR must 
      report data using this elements.

      
- partitionsType

    volume: New element
      This element contains the average volume of one partition 
      in nanoliter (nl).

    endPtTable: New optional element
      This element contains the filename string. See fist section.

    data (partitionDataType): The element can occur 1 to unlimited times.
      As data can also be in the partitions element, there can be
      RDML files without data elements.


- partitionDataType

    tar: New element
      The target id.

    pos: New element
      Positive partitions - The number of positive partitions.

    neg: New element
      Negative partitions - The number of negative partitions.

    undef: New optional element
      Undefined partitions - The number of undefined or not yet scored partitions.

    excl: New optional element
      Excluded partitions - The number of excluded partitions.

    conc: New optional element
      Concentration - The concentration in copies per microliter reaction mix.
