Changes between RDML v1.1 to v 1.2

- sampleType

    annotation: New element occurring 0 to unlimited times
      This element has two subelements, property and value, both strings.
      It should be used to annotate the properties of samples.
      
    templateRNAQuality: Element was removed
      Use the annotation element instead. 
      
    templateDNAQuality: Element was removed
      Use the annotation element instead.
      
    templateRNAQuantity: Element was removed
      Use the templateQuantity element instead.
      
    templateDNAQuantity: Element was removed
      Use the templateQuantity element instead.

    templateQuantity: New optional element
      Use this element to define the nucleotide concentration of
      the template.
      It has the subelements:
        - conc
          Concentration of the template in nanogram per microliter in the 
          final reaction mix.
        - nucleotide
          The type of nucleotide used as template. Possible values are genomic DNA,
          cDNA, DNA, RNA.
         
- targetType
       
    amplificationEfficiencySE: New optional element
      The standard error of the value provided in "amplificationEfficiency" 
      should be given.
      
- dataType

    bgFluorSlp: New optional element
      This element contains the slope of the baseline function.
      Background fluorescence slope - The slope of the baseline trend 
      based on the estimated background fluorescence. The element should 
      be absent to indicate a slope of 0.0; If this element is present 
      without the bgFluor element it should be ignored.

Clarifications of existing elements without functional changes:

- sampleType

    quantity:
      Quantity - The reference quantity of this sample. It should be only used if the 
      sample is part of a standard curve. The provided value will be used to quantify 
      unknown samples in absolute quantification assays.  
      Only the use of true numbers is valid like 1, 10, 100, 1000 or 1, 0.1, 0.01, 
      0.001. The use of exponents is not valid like 1, 2, 3, 4 or -1, -2, -3, -4 
      because it will not be interpreted as 10E1, 10E2, 10E3, 10E4 or 10E-1, 10E-2, 
      10E-3, 10E-4.         

- targetType
      A target is a defined PCR reaction. PCR reactions for the same gene 
      which differ in primer sequences are considered different targets.

- dataType      
      
    bgFluor: Clarification of the documentation:
      Background fluorescence - The y-intercept of the baseline trend 
      based on the estimated background fluorescence.


    excl: Clarification of the documentation:
      Excluded - If present, this entry should not be evaluated. Do not set 
      this element to false if this entry is valid, leave the entire 
      element out instead. 
      It may contain a string with reason for exclusion. Several reasons 
      for exclusion should be separated by semicolons ";".
      
    dpAmpCurveType / dpMeltingCurveType // fluor: Clarification of the documentation:
      Fluorescence - The fluorescence intensity measured without any correction.
      The fluorescence intensity must not be baseline corrected.
      

- idType

    Clarification of the documentation: A ID must be at least one 
    character and unique. The id should be a human readable short name as 
    it was provided by the user.

- targetType

    amplificationEfficiency: Clarification of the documentation:
      Amplification efficiency should be given as the fold-increase of DNA 
      per cycle (the base of the exponential function), for example 1.95 
      for 95% efficiency.
