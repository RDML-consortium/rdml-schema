- samples also have a xRef now.

- changed order: in teargetType xRef moved behind documentation. 

- all elements in cdnaSynthesisMethodType are optional for increased flexibility.

- dnaseTreatment was moved from sample to cdnaSynthesisMethodType because a 
  DNAse treatment makes only sense in a cDNA synthesis context.

- targetType: also has a description string now

- oligoType: The sequence is not optional any more
