Changes in revision 41:

- cqDetectionMethod has additional type "other" (Jans tip)

- primingMethod has additional type "oligo-dt and random" (Jans tip)

- in sample templateQuantity and templateQuality were split up in 
  two fields, one for RNA the other for DNA.  (Jans tip)


Changes in revision 40:

- samples also have a xRef now.

- changed order: in teargetType xRef moved behind documentation. 

- all elements in cdnaSynthesisMethodType are optional for increased flexibility.

- dnaseTreatment was moved from sample to cdnaSynthesisMethodType because a 
  DNAse treatment makes only sense in a cDNA synthesis context.

- in dataCollectionSoftwareType thermalCyclingConditionsId can occur only once.

- cdnaSynthesisMethodType has a thermalCyclingConditionsId for cDNA synthesis.

- added an documentationID in annotationType 

Changes in revision 38:

- all IDs have to be at least 1 letter long (Thanks Daniel!)

- changed order in sampleType to have description and documentation following ID

- changed order in targetType to have description and documentation following ID

- added documentationID in targetType, experimentType, sampleType,
  thermalCyclingConditionType to link to one or unlimited documentationType.

- added documentationType in rdml (similar to samples and targets)

- rdmlIdType: added optional element MD5hash


Changes in revision 37:

- added rdml: namespace everywhere

- fixed error of sampleIdKeyRef

- fixed errors of keyRef


Changes in revision 36:

- sequenceType: string has now IUPAC case matching 

- targetType: also has a description string now

- oligoType: The sequence is not optional any more
- sequencesType: Forward primer, reverse primer and amplicon are optional
  This allows to specify any combination of primers and amplicons.
  
- experimentType: name element renamed to description.

- thermalCyclingConditionType: name element renamed to description.
