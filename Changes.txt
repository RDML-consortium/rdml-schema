Changes in revision 44:

- Fixed typos in annotations (Thanks to Daniel)

- Modified some annotations


Changes in revision 43:

- added Endpoint in data

- ampEff in data is deleted

- well is renamed to react (for reaction)

- added explanation to the elements which are not crystal clear

- added quantity in sample to allow absolute quantification of copies

- deleted templateIsolationMethod

- pcrFormat is not optional any more

- in pcrFormat "undescribed format" is renamed to "free format"


Changes in revision 42:

- organism in target removed

- rtPrimerDbId in target removed

- annotation in experiment removed

- Annotation in run removed, subelements are now in run

- backgroundDeterminationMethod, cqDetectionMethod and 
  thermalCyclingConditionsId are now in run


Changes in revision 41:

- cqDetectionMethod has additional type "other" (Jans tip)

- primingMethod has additional type "oligo-dt and random" (Jans tip)

- in sample templateQuantity and templateQuality were split up in 
  two fields, one for RNA the other for DNA.  (Jans tip)


Changes in revision 40:

- samples also have a xRef now.

- changed order: in teargetType xRef moved behind documentation. 

- all elements in cdnaSynthesisMethodType are optional for increased flexibility.

- dnaseTreatment was moved from sample to cdnaSynthesisMethodType because a 
  DNAse treatment makes only sense in a cDNA synthesis context.

- in dataCollectionSoftwareType thermalCyclingConditionsId can occur only once.

- cdnaSynthesisMethodType has a thermalCyclingConditionsId for cDNA synthesis.

- added an documentationID in annotationType 

Changes in revision 38:

- all IDs have to be at least 1 letter long (Thanks Daniel!)

- changed order in sampleType to have description and documentation following ID

- changed order in targetType to have description and documentation following ID

- added documentationID in targetType, experimentType, sampleType,
  thermalCyclingConditionType to link to one or unlimited documentationType.

- added documentationType in rdml (similar to samples and targets)

- rdmlIdType: added optional element MD5hash


Changes in revision 37:

- added rdml: namespace everywhere

- fixed error of sampleIdKeyRef

- fixed errors of keyRef


Changes in revision 36:

- sequenceType: string has now IUPAC case matching 

- targetType: also has a description string now

- oligoType: The sequence is not optional any more
- sequencesType: Forward primer, reverse primer and amplicon are optional
  This allows to specify any combination of primers and amplicons.
  
- experimentType: name element renamed to description.

- thermalCyclingConditionType: name element renamed to description.
