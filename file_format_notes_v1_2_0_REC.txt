RDML File Compression and File extensions

The xml file containing the RDML compliant data should be stored in a
file named rdml_data.xml. This file should be compressed using pkzip
compatible compression into an archive. The archive can have any name,
but instead of having the extension .zip it should have the extension
.rdml (preferably) or .rdm.

Software should be able to read compressed .rdml or .rdm files as well
as uncompressed .xml files.

The XML file should be encoded in UTF-8, \n should be used as newline 
character and a point "." as decimal separator.

XML is used to be human readable. All id strings in the file should 
be unique short names as provided by the user. Do not use random 
generated strings as ids, as they should be displayed to the user for 
example to identify different samples.

If several strings have to be combined, use a ";" semicolon as separator.
This is required for example in the "excl" element in the "data" section 
of the "react": The different reasons for exclusion have to be separated 
by ";" semicolons. Do not set the value to "false" if it should be 
included, just do not set this element.
